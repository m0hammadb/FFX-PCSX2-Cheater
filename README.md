# FFX-PCSX2-Cheater

This hobby project is inspired by the FFXCutsceneRemover project. I want to create new ways to play FFX in PCSX2.
Currently it has one scenario in which for every 10 battles you participate in your inventory gets fully reset and it will be filled by 10 random items, which can be anything from potion to Master Spheres.
It will get much harder than you think specially if you don't grind
